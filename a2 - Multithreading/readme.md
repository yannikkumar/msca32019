This assignment asks you to create a Bank class which employs a number of tellers.
The tellers all work in parallel to accept customers from a queue and process their transactions.
Everything, except for a few user defined exceptions, will be contained within the bank class. 

You will need to employ a few libraries to make this work, so go read the docs!!
You will need to use threads, a lock, and a queue.
